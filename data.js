        body: "Chayanne is one of the dragon eggs in the QSMP. After the dragon parent had gone missing, the egg was adopted by Missasinfonia and Phil during the Partner Egg Event on April 3, 2023. He resides in Garden of Hope and Music, a safe basement under Phil's house along with Tallulah, due to her shared home not being reinforced. Chayanne is a white, pixelated egg with two black legs sticking out of its shell. He sports a vibrant yellow duck ring floatie, complete with an orange beak and light brown eyes. According to him, the duck floatie gives him with superpowers. After the kidnappings on April 30, 2023, Chayanne returned home with a crack on his eggshell. After the dragon had gone missing, its eggs were placed in an adoption facility. During the egg event on day 13, Missa and Phil received the same ticket and later retrieved their egg at the adoption center. They named the egg Chayanne and built a small home for it called 'Casa Bonita', which means 'pretty house' in Spanish. Chayanne has had quite an eventful journey despite being well taken care of. His first instance of danger occurred when Slimecicle and JuanaFlippa broke in and attempted to kill him while he was asleep. However, this death is considered non-canonical due to technicalities.",

        body: "On day 16, April 6, 2023, Chayanne lost a life due to parental neglect. This was unintentional, as Philza had completed Chayanne's tasks but was not streaming, so it did not count. Since then has been living on 'Hardcore Mode' ever since, which led to Phil being overprotective and Chayanne becoming the most geared-up egg on the island. Despite being constantly protected, Chayanne has managed to have his own share of experiences. He has met and conversed with other members and eggs and even tamed a cat named Avocado, who has kept the phantoms at bay. One of his most iconic moments was when he committed his first arson and subsequent arsons. Missa also provided Chayanne with the infamous Skeleton armor, which he is frequently seen wearing. Chayanne has also faced challenges like when he and the other eggs were abducted and imprisoned underground, only to be rescued by Foolish and Fit. Chayanne has also showcased his bravery by killing a green dragon at one point.",

        body: "Recently Chayanne has developed a hobby of cooking and will do so at just about every opportunity. His favorite dishes have potatoes but he loves cooking other things, even when it isn't quest related. He was asked to cater for Tallulah's Birthday and Cellbit and Roier's wedding and accepted immediately. Minutes after being asked to cater the wedding Chayanne already had the menu planned out. The menu consisted of an appetizer of cesar salad, a potato soup, Stuffed Pumpkin and Roasted Chicken for the main meal, and Raspberry Trifle for dessert. For Tallulah's birthday, he prepared stuffed pumpkin and sushi for dinner and three pies for cake, as well as the candy for the piñata.",

        body: "Chayanne has a strong attachment to both his parents. Philza, due to his Hardcore tendencies, tends to be very protective over his ovipositor kid. This being said, Chayanne has aided his dad in many ways, in combat and even helping him complete food-related quests. Phil has been the source for a lot of Chayanne's qualities and admirations, with him being the one to tell stories of Technoblade, Minecraft Championship, and even his own adventures in his Hardcore Season 4 world.",

Parallels are often drawn between them as Chayanne aspires to emulate Technoblade's strength and the wit needed to triumph against adversaries. Inspired by his idol, Chayanne has even started his own potato farm with the ambitious goal of farming 100,000 potatoes. This goal has been reached.",

While Wilbur holds Chayanne in high regard due to Tallulah's admiration, they still engage in a form of sibling rivalry. They frequently engage in 'brotherly spats'. Despite this, they still seem to care for each other—If the need arose, it is unlikely that Chayanne wouldn't try to defend Wilbur. The same is true for Wilbur.",

He has even dedicated himself to protecting the eggs on the server. Their bond has been described as 'yin and yang', as they complement each other perfectly and seem inseparable.

On Day 92, Cellbit took care of Chayanne and Tallulah when Philza was away and they had a good time together, especially when they destroyed a village together and Chayanne loved doing it. At the end of the day, Cellbit told the eggs a story and said goodbye by kissing them each on the forehead.",

The first instance was in response to Tallulah wanting Quackity to give a second chance, while the second and third were when Bad and Phil were discussing about Ninho. So far, the only recorded instances of Chayanne speaking are 'No' in both instances and 'Yes' in the second instance. It's worth noting that they are AI voices, and not the admin's actual voice. In a somewhat Meta note, Chayanne's admin also plays Cucurucho. As a result, he has been occasionally known to 'use' this ability by accidentally pressing the text to speech buttons. This usually has humorous results.",
